"""KERNEL_DEFAULTS K2 / K3 — the RAG answer contract.

These two claims live here, not in any one block, because every
rag-tagged answer layer has to say the same two things or the store
is lying in different voices.

K2  SOURCE-CLASS RENDERING
    Every chunk a RAG answer layer emits carries ``source_class``. The
    answer layer renders that class; a citation without a class is
    indistinguishable from one with a class, and that is the defect.

K3  COVERAGE HONESTY
    An answer that can measure its corpus says so with an ``N of M
    indexed`` line. Below 100% coverage the answer MUST NOT claim that
    something ``does-not-exist``: an incomplete index cannot support a
    negative existence claim. The cheap way to look complete is to
    pretend the missing tenth is not there.

WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A BLOCK
------------------------------------
There is no ``rag_core`` base class in this store (verified at
``ddda63f``: no module, no class, no kit by that name). Inventing one
so these rules had a parent would be a parallel architecture. The
contract is the parent. A block is RAG-derived when its tags include
``rag``, or when it is the kernel answerer (``grounded_answer``). Both
are required to go through the helpers below.

STORE-ENFORCED, THEN REPORTED
-----------------------------
The helpers raise :class:`AnswerContractViolation` when a caller tries
to emit an unclassified chunk or a ``does-not-exist`` claim on a
partial index. That is the gate. Lane 2's conformance table *also*
checks the same two claims, REPORT-ONLY, so the backlog is visible
without turning the store red. The flip to enforcing the table is a
separate PR.
