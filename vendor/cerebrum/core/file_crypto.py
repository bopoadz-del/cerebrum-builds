"""Encryption at rest for uploaded documents.

The platform stores uploaded documents in ``DATA_DIR`` as files. This module
adds optional symmetric encryption (Fernet) so those files are ciphertext on
disk.

Design — OPT-IN, transparent, backward-compatible
-------------------------------------------------
* The feature is driven entirely by the ``DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`` env var. It
  must hold a valid Fernet key (generate one with
  ``Fernet.generate_key()``). If the var is unset, encryption is OFF and every
  function behaves exactly as before — plaintext in, plaintext out — so the
  default test/dev experience is unchanged.
* Reading is backward-compatible: ``read_document`` / ``open_plaintext``
  inspect the bytes on disk and only decrypt files that actually look like a
  Fernet token. Pre-existing plaintext files in ``DATA_DIR`` keep working even
  after a key is configured.

Public API
----------
* ``encryption_enabled() -> bool``
* ``encrypt_bytes(data) -> bytes`` / ``decrypt_bytes(token) -> bytes``
* ``looks_encrypted(blob) -> bool``
* ``write_document(path, data)``        — encrypts iff enabled
* ``read_document(path) -> bytes``      — returns plaintext, decrypting iff needed
* ``open_plaintext(path)`` (context manager) — yields a real filesystem path
  containing plaintext (the original file when unencrypted, a secure temp copy
  when encrypted; the temp copy is removed on exit).
